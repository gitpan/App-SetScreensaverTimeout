KNOWN BUGS

      * Sometimes fail to lock on KDE

      KDE is supposed to pick up on the changes in
      `~/.kde/share/config/kscreensaverrc` immediately, and this is
      confirmed by running the dialog `kcmshell4 screensaver`. However,
      sometimes the change does not take effect and the screensaver won't
      trigger even after the timeout has long passed.
