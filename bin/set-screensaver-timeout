=head1 NAME

set-screensaver-timeout - Set screensaver timeout

=head1 VERSION

This document describes version 0.08 of set-screensaver-timeout (from Perl distribution App-SetScreensaverTimeout), released on 2015-01-08.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

Usage:

 % set-screensaver-timeout [options] [timeout]

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Provide a common way to quickly set screensaver timeout. Will detect the running
screensaver/desktop environment and set accordingly. Supports xscreensaver,
gnome-screensaver, and KDE screen locker. Support for other screensavers will be
added in the future.

=over

=item * xscreensaver

To set timeout for xscreensaver, the program finds this line in
C<~/.xscreensaver>:

  timeout:    0:05:00

modifies the line, save the file, and HUP the xscreensaver process.

=item * gnome-screensaver

To set timeout for gnome-screensaver, the program executes this command:

  gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.session idle-delay 300

=item * KDE

To set timeout for the KDE screen locker, the program looks for this line in
C<~/.kde/share/config/kscreensaverrc>:

  Timeout=300

modifies the line, save the file.

=back

=head1 OPTIONS

C<*> marks required options.

=over

=item B<--config-path>=I<s>

{en_US Set path to configuration file}.

Can be specified multiple times.

=item B<--config-profile>=I<s>

{en_US Set configuration profile to use}.

=item B<--format>=I<s>

{en_US Choose output format, e.g. json, text}.

=item B<--help>, B<-h>, B<-?>

{en_US Display this help message}.

=item B<--json>

{en_US Set output format to json}.

=item B<--naked-res>

{en_US When outputing as JSON, strip result envelope}.

{en_US 
By default, when outputing as JSON, the full enveloped result is returned, e.g.:

    [200,"OK",[1,2,3],{"func.extra"=>4}]

The reason is so you can get the status (1st element), status message (2nd
element) as well as result metadata/extra result (4th element) instead of just
the result (3rd element). However, sometimes you want just the result, e.g. when
you want to pipe the result for more post-processing. In this case you can use
`--naked-res` so you just get:

    [1,2,3]
}


=item B<--no-config>

{en_US Do not use any configuration file}.

=item B<--timeout>=I<s>

{en_US Value, default in minutes}.

=item B<--version>, B<-v>

=back

=head1 FILES

B</etc/set-screensaver-timeout.conf>

=head1 COMPLETION

This script has shell tab completion capability with support for several shells.

=head2 bash

To activate bash completion for this script, put:

 complete -C set-screensaver-timeout set-screensaver-timeout

in your bash startup (e.g. C<~/.bashrc>). Your next shell session will then recognize tab completion for the command. Or, you can also directly execute the line above in your shell to activate immediately.

It is recommended, however, that you install L<shcompgen> which allows you to activate completion scripts for several kinds of scripts on multiple shells. Some CPAN distributions (those that are built with L<Dist::Zilla::Plugin::GenShellCompletion>) will even automatically enable shell completion for their included scripts (using C<shcompgen>) at installation time, so you can immadiately have tab completion.

=head2 tcsh

To activate tcsh completion for this script, put:

 complete set-screensaver-timeout 'p/*/`set-screensaver-timeout`/'

in your tcsh startup (e.g. C<~/.tcshrc>). Your next shell session will then recognize tab completion for the command. Or, you can also directly execute the line above in your shell to activate immediately.

It is also recommended to install C<shcompgen> (see above).

=head2 other shells

For fish and zsh, install C<shcompgen> as described above.
